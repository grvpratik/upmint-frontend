Those, are called the Synthetix.Now, in 2247 (after almost 300 years!), when Earth has indeed become extinct from all the environmental damage imposed by humanity, 6,666 synthetic humans arose and carrying the minds of their original bodies, they are inspired to rebuild the once-beautiful Earth.The 6,666 “survivors” begin to spread out and travel all across the globe to “trek-in” at every places they’ve crossed.
